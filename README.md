# Python Web Enumeration Tool

This tool will be updated slowly as I learn more about website enumeration.  
More features will be added over the course of the next couple of years.

## Planned Features:

- Site crawler
- Make a graphic showing the hierarchy of the website 
- Directory Bruteforce (similar to dirbuster or gobuster)

This list is not complete and will be updated in the future


## Tools and Technologies used:

- Python 3.10.4 (see requirements.txt for full list of modules used)
